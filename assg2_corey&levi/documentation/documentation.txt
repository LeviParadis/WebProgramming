The objective of the application is to allow users to create characters
for the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

They can do this by giving them a name, level, and selecting a variety
of attributes from a list and then submitting that.

They can then search by character name and view all of the stats for the
character they created. For example, the class features will be included
when they view their character.

The database model is visualized in the entity-relationship diagram (please
see the png included in the folder). The primary table is the characters
which relates to races, classes, and backgrounds. Classes also includes
class features.

First we setup our Amazon web services accounts (registered)
Next we created an EC2 instance
	-We gave it an Ubuntu server
	-An HTTP security group
We set up the EC2 instance
	-SSH'd into Ubuntu
	-Installed xammp
	-Configured all the xampp files as per the course slides
We then uses SCP to copy our code (using our secure keys) up to Ubuntu

We worked in a pair and created two separate instances with the same code:
Corey Hickson's instance:
